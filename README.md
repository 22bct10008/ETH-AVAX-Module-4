# Project Title

DegenToken: Decentralized Token with Item Redemption

## Description

DegenToken is a decentralized ERC-20 token smart contract that offers functionality for minting, transferring, burning tokens, and redeeming items using tokens. The contract provides an interface for users to interact with the token and make use of its features.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To use the DegenToken smart contract, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or copy the smart contract code.
2. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed, such as OpenZeppelin's ERC20 contracts.

### Executing program

To deploy and interact with the DegenToken contract:

1. Deploy the contract on a compatible blockchain network using a smart contract deployment tool like Remix or Truffle.
2. After deployment, the contract owner can mint Degen tokens to different addresses using the `mintDegen` function.
3. Users can view their Degen token balances using the `getDegenBalance` function.
4. Users can transfer Degen tokens to other addresses using the `transferDegenTokens` function.
5. Users can burn Degen tokens using the `burnDegen` function.
6. Users can explore available items using the `exploreItems` function.
7. To redeem an item, users can call the `redeemItem` function with the chosen item's index and send the required amount of tokens.
